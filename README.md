Analysis

Based on the results from the bar graph, Drugs Capomulin and Ramicane had the highest number of Observed Mouse timepoints, both well over 200. 

It is also observed that the distribution of female(49%) versus male(51%) mice used is almost equal. 

When analyzing the box plot results of tumor volume distribution for each treatment group, it is apparent that the drugs Infubinol and Ceftamin have the highest final tumor volume. 

A negative correlation is shown in the line chart comparing tumor volume and timepoint days. Specifically using the drug Capomulin, the tumor volume dropped almost 8 mm3 within a 15 dat time span. 

After running a linear regression model for the Capomulin drug regimen, the data shows that the correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume is 0.84.
